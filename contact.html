	<h1>Description</h1><br>
	<p>Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.</p><br>
	<p>Directed By: Gore Verbinski</p>
	<h2>Critic Reviews</h2>
	<p>"The one bright spot this summer has been Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The story-line is silly, but comprehensible and coherent."(David Walsh)</p></br>
	<p>"Here in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural -- Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious"(David Ansen)</p></br>
	<p>"Both kids and adults will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a lot of fun and well worth checking out. I highly recommend checking it out on the big screen."(Scott Chitwood)</p><br>
